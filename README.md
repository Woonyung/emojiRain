##EmojiRain
[ work in progress ]

:ghost:

* Google chrome extension that makes emojis fall off from your browser depends on the words in your facebook chatting window. 

* It originally started from grabbing contents from gmail inbox, but we thought personal conversations are happened more often in personal spaces– such as gmail chat, facebook feeds or facebook chat. We hope it allows you to appreciate more exciting and happy feeling of feeds from your families/ friends/ etc.

* It is case insensitive.

* This project starts from the assignment for the class, [Appropriating Interaction Technology](https://github.com/lmccart/AppropriatingInteractionTechnologies)–taught by Kyle McDonald and Lauren McCarthy.
